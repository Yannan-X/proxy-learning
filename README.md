# Proxy Learning for SNNs: Sinabs implementation

ProxyLearning was proposed by [Kheradpisheh et al 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13208).
The authors also publish an example notebook based on SpikingJelly on [github](https://github.com/SRKH/ProxyLearning).

This repository attempts to replicate the results and ideas proposed in the paper using the [sinabs](https://github.com/synsense/sinabs) library.
